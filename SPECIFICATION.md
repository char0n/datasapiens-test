 Please impress us by showing what you can do with a simple expense / income app. 
 
 The app should have the following requirements: 
  - The app should have entry categories
  - You should have the ability to add custom categories
  - It should be possible to add/remove them and entries should go uncategorized if category is removed
  - You should be able to group entries into families
  - implement it in the easiest way possible e.g. let's say users with the same last name are the family
  - Some graphs
  - weekly based reports â€“ per user or per family - simple cards will do
